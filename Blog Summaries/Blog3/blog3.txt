This blog describes how to automate the deployment of a React app, using Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), Helm, and GitHub Actions.

Key Steps:

Dockerizing the React App:
Create a Dockerfile to build the app into a container.
Build and test the Docker image locally.

Push Docker Image to Docker Hub:
Log into Docker Hub, tag, and push the image to make it available for deployment.

Setting Up Kubernetes with Minikube:
Start Minikube to run a local Kubernetes cluster.
Create and apply Kubernetes deployment and service files.

Using Helm for Easier Deployment Management:
Install Helm and create a Helm chart to simplify the deployment of an app.

Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions to build the Docker image and deploy the app into Kubernetes whenever code is pushed to the master branch.

Testing the Deployment:
After the configuration of the pipeline, run the deployment by pushing code in GitHub and verify the app has been deployed in Kubernetes.

Conclusion: The process ensures smooth and automated scalable deployments of the app created with React using these tools, thus giving more time to coding and let the automation take care of the deployment.

Tips: 
Dockerize before going to Kubernetes
Local development with Minikube
Helm makes deploying in Kubernetes a lot simpler
GitHub Actions is well capable of CI/CD.

The blog provides a rather detailed, step-by-step guide with code snippets and screenshots, including practical tips on how to set up the deployment pipeline.
