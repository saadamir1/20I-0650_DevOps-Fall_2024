## Foundational Concepts

1. **Virtualization vs. Containerization**:  
   I explored the differences between virtual machines and containers, understanding why containers like Docker are preferred for their lightweight and portable nature, especially in microservices.

2. **Docker**:  
   I learned Dockerâ€™s lifecycle and commands, and how it ensures consistency across environments, playing a critical role in CI/CD pipelines.

3. **Kubernetes**:  
   I understood Kubernetesâ€™ role in managing and orchestrating containerized applications, ensuring scalability, availability, and streamlined deployments in production environments.

4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:  
   I gained experience using Terraform to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning, including setting up EKS clusters on AWS.

5. **CI/CD Pipelines**:  
   I worked on automating the build, test, and deployment process through continuous integration and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.

6. **Cloud Cost Optimization**:  
   I learned strategies like autoscaling and selecting cost-effective instance types to optimize cloud expenses without compromising performance.

7. **Policy as Code**:  
   I explored using tools like Kyverno to enforce security and compliance policies via code in automated environments.
